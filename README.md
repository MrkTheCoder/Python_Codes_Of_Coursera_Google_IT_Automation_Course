# Python Codes Of "Google IT Automation" course
The course of [Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation. "link") is from Coursera.

Here is a list of my Python code categorized by each course I practiced:

### Course 2: Using Python to Interact with the Operating System
- [System Health Check - Python Code](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/Python_Codes_Of_Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_Course/blob/main/Course%2002%20-%20Using%20Python%20to%20Interact%20with%20the%20Operating%20System/health_check.py "Python Code") - [Documentation](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/Python_Codes_Of_Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_Course/blob/main/Course%2002%20-%20Using%20Python%20to%20Interact%20with%20the%20Operating%20System/health_check.md "Doc")
- Working with log files. Based on one of the Qwiklabs exams. This is not the copy-and-paste code from that exam, but it is my algorithm:
  - I wrote my code by only looking at its description before the exam: [My code Before exam](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/Python_Codes_Of_Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_Course/blob/main/Course%2002%20-%20Using%20Python%20to%20Interact%20with%20the%20Operating%20System/module_4_qwiklabs_work_with_log_files__my_code_before_see_exam_description.py)
  - This is the same code, but I refactored it after the exam: [My code After exam](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/Python_Codes_Of_Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_Course/blob/main/Course%2002%20-%20Using%20Python%20to%20Interact%20with%20the%20Operating%20System/module_4_qwiklabs_work_with_log_files__my_code_before_see_exam_description.py)
- My code "[gamers_log.py](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/Python_Codes_Of_Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_Course/blob/main/Course%2002%20-%20Using%20Python%20to%20Interact%20with%20the%20Operating%20System/gamers_log.py)" and its log text file "[gamers.log](https://github.com/MrkTheCoder/Python_Codes_Of_Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_Course/blob/main/Course%2002%20-%20Using%20Python%20to%20Interact%20with%20the%20Operating%20System/gamers.log)", demonstrate a few things [Documentation will be added soon]:
  - How to use 'Named groups' in Regex.
  - How beneficial is it to use the collections module and its defaultdict object over a regular dictionary class in Python?
  - How beneficial is it to use the operator module and its itemgetter function?
  - How to sort complicated dictionaries.
  - How to write a unit testing for a function with dependency to open a text file?
